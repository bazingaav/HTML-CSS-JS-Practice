* **Navbar:** Created a navbar that scrolls away together with the page (ie. navbar becomes invisible and is not fixed to the top when you scroll the page down). 
The navbar has a company name called "Food, LLC" that is always aligned to the left side of the navbar. 
* **Navbar - Mobile View:** Created a simple menu button . When the user clicks that button, a dropdown menu appears.
The dropdown menu contains 3 items & takes up the entire width of the browser window. 
The dropdown menu has a background color that distinguishes it from the rest of the content.
* **Page Heading:** The page heading that says Our Menu is centered within the browser window using Bootstrap class.
* Ceated a single really tall section that uses the Bootstrap Grid and takes up the entire width of the browser window for all views: 
desktop, tablet, and mobile. Thus, scrolling is enabled to view all the content
